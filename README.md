# WearDemo
A simple grocery list app to demonstrate some of the Android Wear APIs.  The list on the phone is mirrored to the watch, and either device can delete items.

Built for a presentation at the Charlotte Android Developers meetup on
July 14, 2015.  Slides will be posted after the presentation.
